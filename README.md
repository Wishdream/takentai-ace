Tankentai Sideview Battle System v1.0 by Enu
============
Translation 1.2b by Wishdream
====

Greetings and salutations, I'm Wishdream. You may know me before as Issa from my Tankentai Animation Shop, or probably Xeol from my old projects.

I've been wondering for quite a while why there isn't any actual translation of the Tankentai system, all I've seen is instructions to make it work. So I did what I did, a 100% translation of the system. Not exactly useful without documentation, so I took my time to translating this. I understand that this script is also not translated because it is recognized for it's ease of use but a lot of those people cannot use it to the extent of using it on it's fullest potential.

Otherwise, I hope this proves to be helpful to the users who are still interested in this.
 
## Note
This is a sideview battle system, sideview as in any direction sideview. See examples of this in the screenshots.
